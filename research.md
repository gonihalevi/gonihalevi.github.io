## Works in progress
### Nuclear reactions in NS-WD accretion disks
Starting in January 2018, I have been working to implement a nuclear reaction network within the MHD code Athena++ with the goal of simulating the evolution of the torus that forms when a white dwarf is disrupted by a companion neutron star. Accretion disks formed in this way are interesting because the timescales for nuclear reactions to occur can be comparable to the dynamical time in the disk, such that energy deposited by these reactions can dynamically affect the disk structure. Past work has shown that detonations may occur and power a relatively low-luminosity, rapidly-evolving transient. In collaboration with [Jim Stone](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~jstone/), I plan to check whether we can reproduce these results in MHD, with real MRI-driven turbulence rather than an alpha viscosity. We hope to verify under which conditions these detonations happen and look into the detailed effects of nuclear reactions on the disk and of turbulence on the composition and structure of the torus. Relevant references include: [Zenati, Peretz, and Toonen (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018arXiv180709777Z/abstract), [Fern√°ndez & Metzger (2013)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2013ApJ...763..108F/abstract), and [Margalit & Metzger (2016)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016MNRAS.461.1154M/abstract).
