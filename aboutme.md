# About Me
---
<img src="figures/portrait.jpg" alt="me" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="50" width="300px"/> I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, and grew up in the heart of the Silicon Valley in California. I was lucky enough to get to stay in the Bay Area for college and live in the wonderful city of Berkeley. Recently, I've (reluctantly) relocated to Princeton and learned the word 'muggy' as a weather descriptor. The most disappointing things about living in Princeton are the summers, the winters, scary thunderstorms during both, a lackluster restaurant and bar scene, needing to own a brush and a scraper, and being really really far from my dog, Kaya. They have nice trees here, though.

Apart from physics and astronomy, I enjoy reading, writing, traveling, sailing, spending time outdoors (especially near or in bodies of water), and all forms of art. I make linoleum blockprints as often as possible, rarely go anywhere without a book, and would love to visit just about everywhere in the world. Currently, Morocco, where my maternal grandparents are from, is at the top of the list. I also love coffee (see photographic evidence) and love to work, read, or talk with friends at coffeeshops.
