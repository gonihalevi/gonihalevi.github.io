# About Me

I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, and grew up in the heart of the Silicon Valley in California. I was lucky enough to stay in the Bay Area and live in the wonderful, vibrant city of Berkeley for college. In 2017, I (reluctantly) relocated to Princeton and immediately encountered, for the first time, the word _muggy_ as a weather descriptor. I loved the trees and small independent businesses (especially Rojo's Roastery, the Bent Spoon, Whole Earth Center, and the Garden Theater) in that little town, but was happy to move to Chicago after six years.

Apart from research and teaching, I enjoy practicing yoga, reading, writing, sailing, [film photography](https://www.art-by-goni.me/), printmaking, baking, and many other things. I love coffee (especially medium to dark roast pour-overs) and love to work, read, or talk with friends at coffee shops. I'm also a big fan of good vegetarian food, dark or Belgian beers (never IPAs), kombucha, and fresh figs.
