# About Me

I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, and grew up in the heart of the Silicon Valley in California. I was lucky enough to stay in the Bay Area and live in the wonderful, vibrant city of Berkeley for college. In 2017, I (reluctantly) relocated to Princeton and immediately encountered, for the first time, the word _muggy_ as a weather descriptor. I do love the trees and small independent businesses (especially Rojo's Roastery, the Bent Spoon, Whole Earth Center, and the Garden Theater) in this little town.

Apart from research and teaching, I enjoy practicing yoga, reading, writing, traveling, sailing, [film photography](https://www.art-by-goni.me/), print-making, baking, and many other things. I love coffee (especially medium to dark roast pour overs) and love to work, read, or talk with friends at coffeeshops. I'm also a big fan of good vegetarian food, dark or Belgian beers (never IPAs), kombucha, and fresh figs.
