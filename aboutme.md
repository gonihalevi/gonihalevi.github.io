# About Me

I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, and grew up in the heart of the Silicon Valley in California. I was lucky enough to stay in the Bay Area and live in the wonderful, vibrant city of Berkeley for college. In 2017, I (reluctantly) relocated to Princeton and immediately encountered, for the first time, the word _muggy_ as a weather descriptor. The most disappointing things about living in Princeton are the summers, the winters, scary thunderstorms during both, a lackluster restaurant and bar scene, and being way _way_ **way** too far from my family's dog, Kaya. They have nice trees here, though.

Apart from physics and astronomy, I enjoy practicing yoga, reading, writing, traveling, sailing, [analog photography](~/gallery), making/appreciating art, and many other things. I sell my art, specifically, linoleum blockprints [here](https://www.instagram.com/prints_by_goni/?hl=en). I rarely go anywhere without a book and track my reading on my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27519872-goni-halevi) account. I love coffee (see photographic evidence; especially dark roasts) and love to work, read, or talk with friends at coffeeshops. I'm also a big fan of good vegetarian food, dark or Belgian beers (stouts > IPAs forever), kombucha (I brew my own at home now!), and açaí bowls.
