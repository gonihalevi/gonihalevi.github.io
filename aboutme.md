# About Me

I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, and grew up in the heart of the Silicon Valley in California. I was lucky enough to stay in the Bay Area and live in the wonderful, vibrant city of Berkeley for college. In 2017, I (reluctantly) relocated to Princeton and immediately encountered, for the first time, the word _muggy_ as a weather descriptor.

Apart from research and teaching, I enjoy practicing yoga, reading, writing, traveling (pre-COVID19), sailing, film photography, making/appreciating art, and many other things. I rarely go anywhere without a book and track my reading on my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27519872-goni-halevi) account. I love coffee (see photographic evidence; especially dark roasts) and love to work, read, or talk with friends at coffeeshops (again, pre-COVID). I'm also a big fan of good vegetarian food, dark or Belgian beers (never IPAs), kombucha (drinking & brewing), and açaí bowls.
