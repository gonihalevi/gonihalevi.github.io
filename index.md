### Academics
I am a 2nd year PhD student and [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) in the Department of [Astrophysical Sciences](https://web.astro.princeton.edu) at [Princeton](http://princeton.edu). In 2017, I completed my undergraduate education at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu) in the [Physics](http://physics.berkeley.edu) and [Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu) Departments.

### Research
I work in computational, nuclear astrophysics and am primarily interested in high-energy phenomena including supernovae, compact object mergers, thermonuclear burning, and accretion disks. My PhD advisor is [Jim Stone](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~jstone/). 

### Equity & Inclusion, Teaching, and Outreach
I care about making science more accessible and making the field of astronomy more equitable and welcoming to all. I put some thought and effort toward this objective by doing things like teaching college courses in NJ prisons, being an active member of Princeton [WiP](https://wip.princeton.edu/), etc.

### Contact Me
Reach me at [_ghalevi@astro.princeton.edu_](mailto:ghalevi@astro.princeton.edu), or if you're at local, find me in my windowless basement office, **009 Peyton Hall**. Though, I'm not there now because I'm visiting the [KITP](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/) in Santa Barbara, CA, until June 12.
