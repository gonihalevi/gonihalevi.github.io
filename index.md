### Academics
I am a 2nd year grad student in the Department of [Astrophysical Sciences](https://web.astro.princeton.edu) at [Princeton](http://princeton.edu). In 2017, I completed my undergraduate education at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu) in the [Physics](http://physics.berkeley.edu) and [Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu) Departments.

### Research
I work in computational, nuclear astrophysics and am primarily interested in high-energy phenomena including supernovae, compact object mergers, thermonuclear burning, and accretion disks. My current and past work involves the development, execution, and analysis of simulated events. I work toward the goal of answering scientific questions including: _What are the definitive origins of the heaviest elements in the universe? How does the propagation of a thermonuclear burning front on the surface of a neutron star translate into observable properties in the X-ray burst? What exactly happens when nuclear reactions are occuring within an accretion disk on a timescale comparable to the dynamical timescale?_

### Teaching and Outreach
I am passionate about and strongly believe in the need for science to be accessibile to all people. I work hard toward this objective. This work involves both efforts to expose people who might otherwise not encounter much science to the field and efforts to make the scientific community inclusive and comfortable for all those who may want to enter it. I care about teaching astronomy, and doing it well, and about improving the climate in my field and in my department.
