### Academics
I am a 3rd year PhD student and [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) in the Department of [Astrophysical Sciences](https://web.astro.princeton.edu) at [Princeton](http://princeton.edu) and a visiting graduate student at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/) in the [School of Natural Sciences](http://sns.ias.edu/). In 2017, I completed my undergraduate education at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu) in the [Physics](http://physics.berkeley.edu) and [Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu) Departments.

### Research
I work in computational, nuclear astrophysics and am primarily interested in high-energy phenomena including supernovae, compact object mergers, thermonuclear burning, and accretion disks. My PhD advisor is [Jim Stone](https://www.sns.ias.edu/jmstone). 

### Equity & Inclusion, Teaching, and Outreach
I care deeply about math and science education, the accessibility of science, and equity and inclusion in physics, astronomy, and theoretical astrophysics. I put thought and effort toward these goals through my roles as a volunteer instructor of college courses in NJ prisons with [PTI](https://prisonteaching.org/), an executive board member of Princeton [Women in Physics](https://wip.princeton.edu/), the grad student representative on our departmental climate committee, a frequent volunteer at [Peyton Public Observing](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/observatory/publicobserving.php), and more.

### Contact Me
Reach me at [_ghalevi@astro.princeton.edu_](mailto:ghalevi@astro.princeton.edu), or if you're local, find me in my windowless basement office, **015 Peyton Hall** on Princeton's campus, or my other basement office, which does have a teeny corner window, **048 Bloomberg Hall** at the IAS (except for when I'm traveling, which you can see below)
