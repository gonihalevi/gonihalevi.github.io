### Employment and Education
As of August 2024, I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Physics department at Illinois Tech](https://www.iit.edu/physics). Previously, I held a [CIERA](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/) Postdoctoral Fellowship at Northwestern University, where I maintain a Visiting Scholar appointment. In September 2023, I earned my PhD as an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) in the Department of [Astrophysical Sciences](https://web.astro.princeton.edu) at [Princeton](http://princeton.edu) and a visiting graduate student at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/) in the [School of Natural Sciences](http://sns.ias.edu/). Before that, I completed my undergraduate education at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu) in the [Physics](http://physics.berkeley.edu) and [Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu) Departments.

### Research
I work in computational, nuclear astrophysics and am primarily interested in high-energy transient phenomena including supernovae, compact object mergers, thermonuclear burning, and accretion disks. I am particularly interested in using simulations to build more realistic models of transients and improve upon commonly used simplifications or idealized initial conditions. My PhD thesis, ``Toward self-consistent models of high-energy transients from stellar remnants,'' was advised by [Jim Stone](https://www.sns.ias.edu/jmstone). 

### Equity & Inclusion, Teaching, and Outreach
I care deeply about math and science education, the accessibility of science, and equity and inclusion in physics, astronomy, and theoretical astrophysics. I have put thought and effort toward these goals through my roles as a graduate fellow and instructor with [Princeton Prison Teaching Initiative](https://prisonteaching.org/), an executive board member of [Princeton Women in Physics](https://wip.princeton.edu/), a founding member of the Princeton Astrophysics climate committee, a frequent volunteer at [Peyton Public Observing](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/observatory/publicobserving.php) and at [Lick Observatory](https://www.lickobservatory.org/), and more.
