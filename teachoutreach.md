## Equity and Inclusion Efforts
### AstroJustice Reading/Discussion Group
At Berkeley, I was one of the founding members of a social justice focused reading group within the astronomy department, which included undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and research staff. In my last two years at Berkeley, I facilitated the group along with two post-docs and a graduate student, which entailed finding volunteers to lead discussions and handling logistics. We held bi-weekly meetings during which we discussed articles, podcasts, etc. related to issues ranging from imposter syndrom to segregation in public schools to mental health care at universities, and more.

When I arrived at Princeton, there was very little discussion of any social justice issues within the department, and what did occur was limited to the grad student sphere. Along with several other students, I started a Princeton version of AstroJustice in Spring 2018. So far, it's been going strong. 

If you or someone you know has any interest in starting or running such a group, please do not hesitate to reach out! I'm happy to provide materials from past discussions we've had or advice on any aspect of coordinating discussions.

### Climate Committee
When arriving on campus, I was struck by the lack of climate data and initiatives to improve climate in the astronomy department here at Princeton. Inspired by the Berkeley astronomy department once again, and by discussions with people at Princeton through Astrojustice, I approached department administration about conducting a climate survey to gather information and get ideas for future initiatives. 

We have since established a climate committee that includes one staff member, one faculty member, two post-docs, an undergraduate student, a post-baccalaureate student, and a graduate student representative (currently me). The current goal of this committee is to work with the university to administer a climate survey, which should be completed in Fall 2018. Afterward, we plan to use data from the survey to motivate initiatives and changes that will help ensure that Peyton Hall is a comfortable and welcoming place for all.
 
### Mentoring Women in (Astro)Physics
At Princeton, I mentor two female physics majors, which entails regular catch-up sessions and providing general advice and encouragement. I also work with the newly founded Undergraduate Women in Physics group here to advise them on events to host and programs to run. This has been an incredibly rewarding way to get to know the brilliant undergraduate women here and to support them so that the physics community gets to keep them.

My involvement with women in physics mentorship began at Berkeley, where I was a member and coordinator of the 
[Society of Women in the Physical Sciences](https://swps.berkeley.edu/), a student group run by female graduate students. There, I was mentored by women who were more senior then me and also got to mentor younger undergraduate women. This network and community of people with shared experiences made my time as a physics major more manageable and enjoyable, inspiring me to participate in mentorship at Princeton, too.
