# Equity & Inclusion, Teaching, and Outreach

## Equity and Inclusion Efforts
### AstroJustice Reading/Discussion Group
As an undergrad at Berkeley, I was one of the founding members of a social justice focused reading group within the astronomy department, which included undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and research staff. In my last two years at Berkeley, I facilitated the group along with two post-docs and a graduate student, which entailed finding volunteers to lead discussions and handling logistics. We held bi-weekly meetings during which we discussed articles, podcasts, etc. related to issues ranging from imposter syndrom to segregation in public schools to mental health care at universities, and more.

When I arrived at Princeton, there was very little discussion of any social justice issues within the department, and what did occur was limited to the grad student sphere. Along with several other students, I started a Princeton version of AstroJustice in Spring 2018 which still exists. If you or someone you know has any interest in starting or running such a group, please do not hesitate to reach out! I'm happy to provide materials from past discussions we've had or advice on any aspect of coordinating discussions.

### Climate Committee
When arriving at Princeton, I was struck by the lack of climate data and initiatives to improve climate in the department. Inspired by the Berkeley astronomy department once again, and by discussions with people at Princeton through Astrojustice, I approached department administration about conducting a climate survey to gather information and get ideas for future initiatives. This led to the establishment of a climate committee that includes members from every cohort in the department. For three years, I served as a graduate student representative on the committee, which transitioned from being focused on administering and analyzing the first Climate Survey in the department to a standing committee with a vast range of responsibilities related to making the department an equitable and inclusive environment for all.

### Mentoring in (Astro)Physics
I was an invited session leader for an ``Out In STEM'' discussion at the APS's Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics at Temple University. At Princeton, I mentored a number of women in the Physics or Astrophysics majors, which entails regular catch-up sessions and providing general advice and encouragement. My involvement with women in physics mentorship began at Berkeley, where I was a member and coordinator of the 
[Society of Women in the Physical Sciences](https://swps.berkeley.edu/), a student group run by graduate students. There, I was mentored by women who were more senior then me and also got to mentor younger undergraduate women. This network and community of people with shared experiences made my time as a physics major more manageable and enjoyable, inspiring me to participate in mentorship at Princeton, too.

## Teaching Experience
### Princeton Prison Teaching Initiative
I taught four college courses in the New Jersey prison system through the Prison Teaching Initiative ([PTI](https://www.prisonteaching.org/)). The aim of PTI is to provide high-quality higher education to those currently incarcerated in NJ. I've taught astronomy, algebra, and physics at East Jersey State Prison and the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility over the past few years. From 2020 to 2023, I also served as a Graduate Fellow for PTI. In this role, I supported instructional teams and led instructor pedagogy trainings for math and physical science courses.

### Instructing on Princeton's Campus
I served as an Assistant in Instruction (AI) for five courses during my time at Princeton: The Universe (AST 203; Spring 2019; Profs. Chris Chyba, Jo Dunkley, and Michael Strauss), Cosmology (AST 401; Spring 2020; Prof. Neta Bahcall), Life in the Universe (AST 255; Fall 2021; Prof. Chris Chyba), Topics in Modern Astronomy (AST 204; Spring 2022; Prof. Bruce Draine), and Black Holes (AST 206; Spring 2023; Prof. Eliot Quataert). 

### Teaching Astronomy at Berkeley
I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to be a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for four semesters while an undergraduate at Berkeley. I taught two different courses: an introduction to general astronomy for non-majors (Astro C10) taught by Alex Filippenko, and part two of introductory astrophysics for majors (Astro 7B) taught by Eugene Chiang. My teaching responsibilities included independently running discussion sections (mini-lectures with activities and worksheets) for one to two hours per week, as well as running exam review sessions, helping with homework, etc. I was nominated by my department as an exceptional instructor and received the University's [Outstanding GSI Award](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/) in 2017.

### Training Researchers
At Princeton, I had the pleasure of mentoring an undergraduate student: Belinda Wu, on a summer research project that continued into the academic year. As part of my role in Alex Filippenko's research group as an undergraduate, I was responsible for training observers on the telescopes that the group used and teaching the basics of relevant coding and science.

## Outreach

At Princeton, I volunteered at the department's public observing nights and helped out at many one-time outreach events. 

Previously, I was a regular volunteer at [Lick Observatory](http://mthamilton.ucolick.org/) in California during the summer public programs for 3 years in a row. I gave short talks about my research to the observatory's visitors and led tours and explanations of the 1-m telescope. 

When at Berkeley, I was the Outreach coordinator for the University's chapter of the Society of Physics Students and organized participation in many local outreach events. I also volunteered at the Expanding Your Horizons conferences for middle school girls which provides exposure to STEM fields and encourages young girls to explore them. I helped with the astronomy department's public observing nights there, too, and other events within the department.
