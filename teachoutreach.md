## Equity and Inclusion Efforts
### AstroJustice Reading/Discussion Group
At Berkeley, I was one of the founding members of a social justice focused reading group within the astronomy department, which included undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and research staff. In my last two years at Berkeley, I facilitated the group along with two post-docs and a graduate student, which entailed finding volunteers to lead discussions and handling logistics. We held bi-weekly meetings during which we discussed articles, podcasts, etc. related to issues ranging from imposter syndrom to segregation in public schools to mental health care at universities, and more.

When I arrived at Princeton, there was very little discussion of any social justice issues within the department, and what did occur was limited to the grad student sphere. Along with several other students, I started a Princeton version of AstroJustice in Spring 2018. So far, it's been going strong. 

If you or someone you know has any interest in starting or running such a group, please do not hesitate to reach out! I'm happy to provide materials from past discussions we've had or advice on any aspect of coordinating discussions.
